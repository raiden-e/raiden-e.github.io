# Hi, I'm Raiden

I'm wrapping up my Business Informatics degree at FH Dortmund with a thesis on AI-powered video generation. After 3+ years in intenal IT consulting at SITA, I'm ready for my next chapter: **Technical Sales / Solution Consulting in the DACH region**.

I combine a solid tech background (Python, cloud infrastructure, DevOps) with business acumen and a genuine passion for solving problems with the right software. I don't just want to sell - I want to help businesses with solutions I'd use myself.

## Background

I started as a developer and infrastructure guy (PowerShell, Python, networking), but my Business Informatics studies, especially modules like Consultative Selling during my semester abroad, sparked something bigger. I realized I love the human side: understanding pain points, discussing solutions, and making technology work for people, not just systems.

At SITA's Program Office, I've coordinated software rollouts (payment solution migrations across airports), set up tools (SharePoint, Kimai), and moderated workshops between business, IT, and data teams. Honestly? I'm ready for more action. I want to be where solutions meet customers—advising, demoing, closing deals.

My bachelor's thesis dives into `AI-powered video generation from PDFs`, exploring generative AI, multimodal models, avatar synthesis, and ethical implications (deepfakes, consent, authenticity). It's a deep dive into how AI transforms content creation, and the responsibilities that come with it.

## What I Bring to Technical Sales

**Tech fluency meets business thinking.**

I can talk Docker and Proxmox with engineers, then turn around and explain ROI to a CFO. I've managed stakeholder workshops in aviation (not exactly a forgiving industry), translated technical requirements into user stories, and kept multi-team rollouts on track.

**Core skills:**

- **GenAI & AI transformation:** LLMs, prompting, use case development, integration strategies
- **Cloud & infrastructure:** Azure, Docker, self-hosted environments (TrueNAS, Traefik, Crowdsec)
- **Automation & scripting:** Python, PowerShell
- **Consulting & project management:** Agile workflows, stakeholder coordination, workshop facilitation
- **Cross-platform:** macOS, Windows, Linux

I run my own homelab with TrueNAS, Docker stacks, and hardened configurations. Not because I have to, but because I *like* solving problems and understanding how systems work. That curiosity translates directly into presales: I can demo, troubleshoot, and build trust with technical buyers.

## Beyond Work

When I'm not knee-deep in tech, you'll find me:

- Bouldering, climbing, hiking
- Tinkering with my homelab (current setup: TrueNAS, Docker, Crowdsec, Traefik)
- Meeting new people whereever I go.

I'm moving to **Gesrman-speaking Switzerland** and looking for roles where I can combine technical depth with customer impact—whether that's Technical Sales, Presales Engineering, or Solution Consulting in B2B SaaS, Cloud, or AI.
