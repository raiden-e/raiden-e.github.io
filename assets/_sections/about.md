I am a Business Informatics student at FH Dortmund and IT Consultant at [SITA IPS](https://www.materna-ips.com/), where I've spent 3+ years coordinating software rollouts, developing AI use cases, and bridging Business, IT, and Data.

I coordinate multi-stakeholder rollouts in the aviation sector, moderate workshops, and translate technical complexity into business value. Beyond consulting, I maintain my own server infrastructure with Docker and Proxmox, exploring the intersection of DevOps and AI transformation.

Whether it's identifying pain points, developing use cases, or moderating stakeholder workshops, I thrive in roles that combine technical depth with business acumen and communication. Currently open to Technical Sales, Presales, and Solution Consulting roles in B2B SaaS, Cloud, and AI.
