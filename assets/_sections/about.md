I am an exchange student from Germany studying Business Information Systems at [Western Carolina University](https://www.instagram.com/western_carolina/) in North Carolina. I am passionate about marketing and eager to gain hands-on industry experience. During my time at [Materna IPS](https://www.materna-ips.com/), I worked as a working student for three years on automating system deployment solutions.

At Western Carolina University I gained valuable experience across social media, content, and email marketing. I also learned how to design and implement data-driven strategies that support specific business goals. With a strong technical background, I’m excited to focus my energy on marketing—especially social media.

I’m a motivated, results-oriented teammate with a solid work ethic and a willingness to go the extra mile. I look forward to contributing my skills to a marketing team and helping businesses hit their targets.

### What I do

- **Social Media Marketing** – I enjoy building and engaging with audiences, creating compelling content, and measuring outcomes.
- **Branding** – “It’s all about branding.” The tactics are different today, but the impact is stronger than ever.
- **Web Development** – Coding combines puzzle-solving with design, which makes it the perfect creative outlet for me.
- **Sales** – Where psychology, business, and marketing meet, you get ✨sales✨—a complex yet fascinating space.
