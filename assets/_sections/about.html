            I am an exchange student from Germany studying Business Information Systems at Western Carolina University
            in North Carolina. I am passionate about marketing and I am eager to learn more about the industry and gain
            experience in the field. During my time at

                        I really enjoy building and engaging with social media audiences, creating and sharing

                        "It's all about branding." Even pirates knew what power branding can have, and how to do

                        effectively.
                        The methods of branding are less cruel today, but even more powerful for your business!

                        I've worked in Web-Development and also do it as a hobby ever so often. It's a nice balance
                        between
                        puzzeling and designing. Just overall a broad test of creative thinking (until AI came along, at
                        least).

                        If psychology, business and marketing come together, you get ✨SALES✨.
                        Really, all these fields are interesting by themselves.
                        Combined, you get a very complex, though very //interesting// field of work.
